# Cryptocurrencies
This analysis uses Pandas, Plotly, and Sklearn to create an unsupervised machine learning model to group different cryptocurrencies into 4 classes. The purpose of this analysis is to create cryptocurrency groups based on features of algorithm name, prooftype, coin supply, and how many coins have been mined. I also use hvplot and plotly express to visualize my findings. This analysis can be used by institutional or retail investors for exploratory analysis of different cryptocurrencies.
